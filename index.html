                <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
                <p class="summary-text">Phishing attacks are a growing and sophisticated cyber threat often outpacing current preventive measures. This quantitative study explored factors contributing to phishing victimization and identified protective behaviors within the Bahraini population. The analysis utilized Multiple Regression after data validation via Factor Analysis.</p>
                <p class="summary-text">The key findings established that older age groups were more susceptible to successful phishing attacks compared to younger groups, while higher levels of phishing awareness strongly correlated with an increased usage of protective behaviors.</p>
                <p class="summary-text">This research suggests that effective anti-phishing efforts require personalized, engaging educational programs targeting psychological vulnerabilities, alongside technical controls.</p>

                <div class="method-grid">
                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>Despite numerous security tools, phishing remains a primary vector for cyber-attacks. The study focused on understanding the human factors within the Bahraini population that contribute to victimization.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h3>Research Design</h3>
                        <p>A quantitative approach was used, gathering survey responses from the Bahraini population. Data was analyzed to test the relationship between various factors (Age, Awareness, Training) and the dependent variable (Victimization Status).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="method-card">
                        <h3>Analytical Tools</h3>
                        <p>The primary statistical methods involved Factor Analysis for data validation and Multiple Regression Analysis to determine the significance and nature of the relationships between the variables.</p>

                <h2>Key Findings & Data Insights</h2>
                <div class="finding-block">
                    <h3>1. Awareness vs. Protective Behavior</h3>
                    <p class="data-insight">A high level of phishing awareness was found to be the single most significant factor in predicting a reduction in phishing victimization. The model showed a strong negative correlation, reinforcing the effectiveness of educational initiatives.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="finding-block">
                    <h3>2. Age Susceptibility</h3>
                    <p class="data-insight">The analysis revealed that older age groups demonstrated a statistically significant higher susceptibility to successful phishing attacks compared to younger, more digitally native groups. This highlights a critical demographic for targeted training.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="finding-block">
                    <h3>3. Model Performance</h3>
                    <p class="data-insight">The Multiple Regression Model achieved an R Square of 0.320 and an Adjusted R Square of 0.303 (meaning approximately 32% of the variance in victimization is explained by the factors studied). The research constraint was a forced reliance on a 90% confidence level due to an insufficient response count.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion & Future Recommendations</h2>
                <p>The project concludes that focusing solely on technical controls is insufficient. The future of anti-phishing defense lies in improving human resilience. We recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personalized Training: Develop educational programs that adapt to the user's observed level of awareness and technical skill.</li>
                    <li>Targeting Vulnerabilities: Create engaging, scenario-based training that specifically targets the psychological tactics used by attackers (e.g., urgency, authority).</li>
                    <li>Intergenerational Programs: Launch campaigns specifically designed to bridge the digital divide and increase awareness in older demographics.</li>
                </ul>
